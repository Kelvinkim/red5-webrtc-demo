Red5 WEB RTC DEMO APPLICATION (CLIENT AND SERVER)



### Introduction

This application sample demosntrates a simple one to one web-rtc audio / video chat, while using Red5 as its signaling backbone. While  red5 has always been the champion of open source streaming, the inclusion of websockets makes it an efficient open source candidate for realtime communication in the modern web structure.

In this example app we see how Red5 websocket helps in managing sinple chat rooms that host and mediate web-rtc sessions between html/js clients.
